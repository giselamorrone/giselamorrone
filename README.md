# Hi, I'm Gisela 👋  
### Data Engineering Manager | Technical Leader | Strategy & Clarity Builder

I’m a Data Engineering Manager focused on building high-performing teams, scalable data platforms, and clarity in complex systems.  
I combine technical depth with leadership principles centered around ownership, communication, and structured decision-making.

I care deeply about:
- Designing reliable, maintainable, and scalable data platforms  
- Reducing ambiguity through clear ownership and alignment  
- Enabling analytics, ML, and product teams with high-quality data  
- Bringing structure and clarity to engineering organizations
